# Etch-a-Sketch

## Project Overview
This is a web-based Etch-a-Sketch application that allows users to draw by hovering their cursor over a grid. As you move your cursor across the grid cells, they change color, creating a drawing effect similar to the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy.

## Features
- Interactive grid-based drawing area
- Adjustable grid size (up to 100x100)
- Simple, intuitive interface
- Color cells by hovering over them

## How to Use
1. Open https://renoldthomas.github.io/etch-a-sketch in a web browser
2. Hover your mouse over the grid cells to color them
3. Click the "Change grid size?" button to adjust the grid density
4. Enter a number between 1-100 when prompted to set your desired grid size

## Technical Implementation
The project uses vanilla JavaScript to dynamically create and manipulate the grid. CSS Flexbox is used for layout management, creating a responsive grid container.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML structure
- `styles.css`: Styling for the application
- `script.js`: JavaScript functionality for grid creation and interaction

## Future Enhancements
Potential features to implement:
- Color picker for different drawing colors
- Clear button to reset the grid
- Save functionality for created drawings
- Different drawing tools (e.g., fill, erase)
